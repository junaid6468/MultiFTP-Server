# MultiFTP-Server
A lightweight, multithreaded FTP server written in Python. This project enables users to connect via FTP and perform file operations such as uploading, downloading, listing files, and changing directories. It uses Python's `socket` and `threading` libraries to manage concurrent client sessions and a passive mode data transfer approach.
